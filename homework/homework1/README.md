## Problem Statement  
In stock investing and quantitative research, investors rely on various technical indicators (such as moving averages, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.) to analyze trends and make trading decisions. Manually downloading and calculating these indicators is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when data sources are fragmented or need to be updated in real time. The goal of this project is to build an automated tool that can batch-fetch historical stock data and compute common technical indicators, helping investors and researchers conduct market analysis and strategy development more efficiently.  

## Stakeholder & User  
- **Primary stakeholders:** Individual investors, quantitative researchers, and investment research teams.  
- **End users:** Users who need to quickly obtain, calculate, and update stock technical indicators (such as retail investors, analysts, and quantitative traders).  
- **Workflow context:** Users only need to input stock codes and time ranges, and the system will automatically fetch market data, calculate the required technical indicators, and output results for use in Excel/Notebooks/visualization platforms.  

## Useful Answer & Decision  
- **Type:** Descriptive / Artifact  
- **Metric:** Accuracy of indicator calculations (compared with standard libraries), stability of data retrieval, and runtime efficiency.  
- **Artifact:** A script or notebook tool that automatically fetches stock data and computes a set of common technical indicators.  

## Assumptions & Constraints  
- Available data sources (such as Yahoo Finance, Tushare, AkShare, etc.) can provide complete historical stock data.  
- Technical indicators are calculated based on standard formulas and can be validated against professional software.  
- The tool should complete tasks within a reasonable time (e.g., <5 seconds per stock).  
- Must account for API rate limits and data source compliance.  

## Known Unknowns / Risks  
- Data consistency issues across different sources.  
- APIs may have rate limits or require paid subscriptions.  
- Data for less-traded stocks or suspended securities may be incomplete.  
- Users may later demand more complex indicators or cross-market data support.  

## Lifecycle Mapping  
Goal → Stage → Deliverable  
- Establish automated data fetching and indicator calculation workflow → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → Project scoping, README, stakeholder artifact  
- Integrate data sources and basic indicator calculations → Data Collection (Stage 02) → Scripts and cleaned dataset  
- Expand technical indicator library and visualization → Modeling (Stage 03) → Technical indicator analysis and visualization tool  

## Repo Plan  
- **data** – Stores downloaded stock historical data and computed indicators.  
- **src** – Python scripts (data fetching, indicator calculation, API handling).  
- **notebooks** – Jupyter notebooks (exploration, testing, demonstration of results).  
- **docs** – Documentation and reports (project goals, technical notes, user guide).  
- **Cadence for updates** – Weekly updates.
